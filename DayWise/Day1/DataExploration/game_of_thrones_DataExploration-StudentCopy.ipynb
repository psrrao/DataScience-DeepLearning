    "One of the most popular television series of all time, Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama set in fictional continents of Westeros and Essos filled with multiple plots and a huge number of characters all battling for the Iron Throne! It is an adaptation of _Song of Ice and Fire_ novel series by **George R. R. Martin**.\n",

    "Being a popular series, it has caught the attention of many, and Data Scientists aren't to be excluded. This notebook presents **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the _Kaggle_ dataset enhanced by _Myles O'Neill_ (more details: [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones)). This dataset is based on a combination of multiple datasets collected and contributed by multiple people. We utilize the ```battles.csv``` in this notebook. The original battles data was presented by _Chris Albon_, more details are on [github](https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset)\n",
