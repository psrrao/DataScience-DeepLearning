"""
Long Short term Memory

Predict stock price of Google
Predict the upward and downward trend in Google stock price

We will make a LSTM that will capture upward and downward 
trend of Google stock price

We will train LSTM from 5yrs of Google stock price 
i.e. begining of 2012 to the end of 2016 , based on the correlation
identified by the LSTM , we will try to predict the first month 
of 2017 Jan,2017, its not going to predict the stock price
but will try to predict upward or downward trend of Google stock price

We will try to predict the open of the Google stock price
that is the open of the financial year

# number of timesteps tells the RNN what to remember to predict next value
# Creating a data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output
# 60 timesteps means that at each time t the RNN is going to look at 60 stock price before time t 
# based on these 60 timesteps it will predict the next output
# 60 timesteps from past the RNN tries to understand some correlation and based on its understanding it 
# is going to try to predict the stock price
# 60 comes from experiments and 60 previous timesteps corresponds to 3months
# So we trying to look 3 months before to trying to predict the next day
# 60 timesteps and 1 output at time t+1

# X_train which will be the inputs of the neural network
# so for each financial day X_train will contain 60 previous stock prices before that financial day
# y_train which will contain the output
# y_train will contain the stock price of next financial day
